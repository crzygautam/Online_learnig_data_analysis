### **Online Courses Analysis Overview:**

1. **Data Cleaning & Error Identification**:
   - The first step involves cleaning the dataset to ensure accuracy and consistency. This includes identifying and handling missing values, correcting erroneous data, and ensuring that all variables are correctly formatted for analysis.

2. **Count Type Popularity**:
   - Analyze the popularity of different course types based on the count of courses available in each category. This could include categories like video-based courses, written materials, interactive courses, etc.

3. **Average Number of Viewers by Sub-Category**:
   - Calculate the average number of viewers for courses within each sub-category. This helps in identifying which sub-categories (e.g., "Machine Learning" within "Data Science") are the most popular among learners.

4. **Count of Course Types by Language**:
   - Analyze the distribution of courses across various languages to understand the diversity of available course offerings and how they are tailored to different language groups.

5. **Demanding Skills**:
   - Identify the most in-demand skills based on the courses being offered. This can be done by analyzing course titles, descriptions, and tags to understand what skills (e.g., "Python", "Digital Marketing") are most frequently requested by learners.

6. **Average Number of Viewers by Category**:
   - Similar to the sub-category analysis, this focuses on the broader course categories (e.g., "Programming", "Business", "Design") and calculates the average number of viewers for each category to gauge overall popularity.

7. **Number of Viewers per Subtitle Count**:
   - Analyze how the number of subtitles (e.g., English, Spanish, etc.) in a course affects its viewership. This could help identify whether courses with multiple subtitle options attract more viewers due to language accessibility.

8. **Viewership Based on Lecture Duration**:
   - Investigate how the duration of the lectures (e.g., short courses vs. long, detailed courses) influences the number of viewers. This analysis can reveal preferences for course length among learners.

9. **Instructor Rating by Category and Sub-Category**:
   - Analyze instructor ratings based on the categories and sub-categories of courses. This can provide insights into which instructors are highly rated in specific fields, offering a metric for quality in course delivery.

### Summary of Insights:
- By performing this analysis, you can gain a deeper understanding of how different categories and sub-categories of online courses perform in terms of viewership, popularity, and learner preferences. You can also uncover patterns like which course types are more successful in certain languages, how the duration of lectures influences learner engagement, and which skills are most in demand.

This structured approach will help you identify trends, strengths, and areas for improvement in the online course offerings.
